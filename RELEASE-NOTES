Version 0.3.x will be the last release series targeting python 2. All
new development on master is targeting python 3. Only bug fixes with
pull requests will be considered on this branch.

This version contains the scripts for generating parameter files using
GRASS 7 and is required since GRASS doesn't currently (June 2017) work
with Python 3.
